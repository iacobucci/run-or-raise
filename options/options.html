  <p>Run or raise!</br>
  a simple extension to either:</br>
  run (open a tab normally)</br>
  or raise (switch to the already opened tab of the same type).</br>
  <br>
  You can set a list of links that will follow this behaviour, and their positions between other tabs will be ordered accordingly. They will be spawned on either the current window (if there aren't already enabled links open in other window) or in the window that has the most enabled links. Links shall be comma separated, don't leave trailing characters in the textarea.
